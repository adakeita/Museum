                            From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering
                            us
                            unique
                            insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.
                            For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much
                            improved, thanks
                            to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore
                            the
                            history of
                            medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of
                            penicillin
                            and the
                            first heart transplant.
                            Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also
                            from
                            observing
                            animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

                            For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our
                            origins.
                            Where do
                            we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution
                            we
                            have
                            had a
                            framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
                            Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have
                            evolved
                            our time.

                            As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more
                            important
                            it
                            becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for

                            In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face
                            including
                            global
                            warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive
                            ways we
                            can
                            all

                        From the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition is coming to the

                        <br>
                        It's a series of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the
                        elements
                        as we harness them. From solar energy, to "Wind Island" that shows how turbines
                        are able to use and control wind.
