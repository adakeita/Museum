                        Our fantastic exhibition "The Sky Above Us",
                        explores the night
                        sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us.
                        <br>
                        We'll locate the various
                        constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early
                        navigators who used the stars to travel by.
                        <br>

                        For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our
                        origins.
                        Where do
                        we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution
                        we
                        have
                        had a
                        framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
                        Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have
                        evolved
                        our time.
                        You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn't survive,
                        including
                        our
                        Woolly
                        Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

                        As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more
                        important
                        it
                        becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for
                        humans
                        but
                        for
                        the whole planet.
                        In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face
                        including
                        global
                        warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive
                        ways we
                        can
                        all

                        From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us

                        insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.
                        For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much
                        improved,
                        thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we
                        explore the
                        history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery
                        of
                        penicillin and the first heart transplant.
                        Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from
                        observing
                        animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.
