                <em>Energetica Exhibition on Loan</em>
                <br>
                <br>
                From the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition is coming to the
                our Museum.
                <br>
                It's a series of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the
                elements
                as we harness them. From solar energy, to "Wind Island" that shows how turbines
                are able to use and control wind.
